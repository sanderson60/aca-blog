Lesson 9 was much easier for me but still a challenge.  We discussed CSS reset and why this is always a good idea for a webpage.  It takes the website back to zero, basically, and then allows you to style it exactly the way you want it to be without having unknown variables from a browser.  After that discussion we learned to make multiple page websites and spent the rest of the class building this with a partner.

For homework we did the homework portion of Checkpoint 2.  We built a Winery webpage and it was a bit challenging for me.  I ended up with a nice product and I learn more and more by just trying and using google to assist me in information I do not understand.  In the end the product came out very nice. Our reading is “How to use heading in HTML” and “Fonts and Typography”.
