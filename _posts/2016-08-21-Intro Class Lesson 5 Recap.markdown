Lesson 5 in our class was Checkpoint 1.  We had to recreate a website and were promised that if we completed this as homework coming into the class we would get to have fun.  We all did complete the assignment and so we created a mucher nicer starting page for our assignments in Github.

As with all classes we did have homework and had to continue to work on our pages and of course complete reading for the next class.

Our Reading was:  

Tutsplus - The 30 CSS selectors you must memorize

Understanding Style Precedence in CSS

W3School - CSS Selector

Why Specificity Matters

The classes are getting more intense and I am looking forward to all of them.  It is a bit difficlult to get everything in on time but I am still keeping up with assignments, working fulltime and being present in my home life.  All very challenging.
