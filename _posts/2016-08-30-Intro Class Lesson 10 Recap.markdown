Lesson 10 (Checkpoint 2) was a great class and things are starting to gel for me, for now.  We discussed and learned how to use Google Fonts.  This is a great way to have additional fonts in your website but we were also warned that too many could really slow down your website so be cautious in the number of fonts you import.  After the lecture we began working on Checkpoint 2 assignment which was to create a homepage for any business you choose.  I decided to create my own homepage and worked all weekend on the assignment.  It is looking very good, in my opinion, but I will wait for feedback from my instructors for the final verdict.

Our homework was to complete Checkpoint 2 assignment and complete the reading for the next class.  Our next class is on Media Queries and our reading assignment is “W3School - Media query,” “Mozilla - Using Media Queries”, “What you can do with Media Queries,” “Media Queries.”
