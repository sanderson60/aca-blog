Lesson 14 was the beginning of using plugins to make the sites more appealing.  We learned how to make Bootstrap Navigation and it was pretty fun.  We took a previously created project and added Bootstrap navigation.  It was not an overly difficult lesson and actually fun. 

Our homework was to begin Checkpoint 3.  This is another step closer to graduation and presents new challenges and throws in unexpected issues that must be resolved.  It was a lot of fun and I did not have too many issues.  Our next class is Checkpoint 3 and we will also learn Font Awesome and animation.  Class is getting more fun and it is thrilling to know what to do rather than feeling lost all the time.  I am learning and that is why I came to this school.
