Lesson 7 was discussing Floats and Clears. We have been doing some of these in past projects but today we larned them in more detail. 

Honestly this is a portion of the class that is a bit confusing to me and I had a good deal of difficulty getting this to work for me.
I eventually got it but it was challenging.  Our In Class Project was to recreate a website using the new information that was given to us.

It came out pretty good and as with all the classes up to this point the instructors have been great and very helpful.

Our homework will be to recreate a different webpage and to complete our reading.  

Our Reading tonight will be:

Box Model for Beginners

W3School - Box Model

I am almost caught up with past classes and this blog is about to be more current than previously written.  The classes are intense, the instructors are very good and I am enjoying them all.
