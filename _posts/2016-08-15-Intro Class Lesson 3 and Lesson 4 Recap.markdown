Lesson 3 began teaching us about semantic elements.  The theory of this is not hard to understand but is difficut to apply when either is correct and I am not sure if there is a standard that is meant to be followed.  The class was very interesting and as always we had homework to complete and it was not too hard to complete

Our homework for this class:

Fix some code using semantic elements
and to read:
  W3School - CSS Intro and 
  CSS Basics - Introduction to CSS
  
Lesson 4 brought us to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).  This is where the fun begins.  HTML is great and as I have read, many times recently, it is the bones and CSS is the skin.  Working with the two it is amazing what can be created.  Most of the time I am right on track but there are times I get confused and need extra time to figure these things out.  Our instructors are very helpful but they try to get us to figure things out on your own.  This is great since that is the way it will be in the future.
  
Our homework for this class:

Complete Checkpoint 1 (and if that is completed we get to accomplish a fun task) and to start this blog.  There were a few troubles with me getting this Blog started but I got through it and here we are.
  
It appears I am almost caught up and that is good.  More to come soon.
