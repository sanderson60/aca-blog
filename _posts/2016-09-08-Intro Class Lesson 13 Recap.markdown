Lesson 13 was interesting and taught us more about Bootstrap and the responsive utility.  This was fun and the in class project was challenging but not too bad.  Having a good partner to collaborate with is important and fortunately overall I have had great partners to work with.  We created a responsive webpage that works on all platforms.    

Our homework was to complete another webpage using Bootstrap responsive utility and this went very well.  I ran into a few challenges but overcame them without too many troubles.  I am learning a lot and there is so much more to learn.  Our next class is on Bootstrap Navigation and our reading assignment is Bootstrap Navigation Menu. Things are getting more and more fun in the lessons and I am still contemplating on whether or not to take the next class.  The pre-work is daunting and from all reports the class is treacherous. Things are going very well and I look forward to class.
