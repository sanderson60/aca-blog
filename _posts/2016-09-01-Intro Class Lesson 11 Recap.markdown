Lesson 11 was a challenge; I was expecting things to be very difficult but turned out to be easier than anticipated.  This lesson was all about Media Queries and it sounded intimidating.   As we got into the lesson it clicked for whatever reason and my partner and I were able to complete our project with few difficulties.  The instructor explained the readings in such a manner that it made sense to me.  A great class and I feel I am catching on to the coding aspect of things.

Our homework was to complete another webpage using Media Queries and complete the reading for the next class.  Our next class is on Bootstrap Framework and our reading assignment is W3School - Bootstrap Grid system, Sitepoint â€“ Bootstrap Grid system and CDN.  Things are heating up in the lessons and there is already a decision matrix on whether or not to take the next class.  Things are going very well and I look forward to class.
