Lesson 6 introduced us to CSS precedence and selectors.  We have already been using some of these theories but it was good to know the theory behind the use of these items.  Overall this class was not too difficult and our in class project was to recreate a website that was given to us in the lesson.  As with all of our projects we worked in teams and completed this project.
For homework we worked on the CSS Diner and Flex froggy.

We also had reading to complete and Those reading assignments were:

Document Flow

CSS Trick - All About floats

A List Apart - CSS float 101

I am enjoying the classes and the instructos.  It has been an exhilirating 3 weeks and I look forward to the next step.
