Lesson 15 was Checkpoint 3 and this was a challenging assignment.  Overall the project went well and it was a lot of fun incorporating all that I have learned.  As a class we discussed what we had done and collaborated on differences and how they were accomplished.  We also learned Font Awesome and CSS animation.  Both of these assist in the styling of the webpage and are tools in your toolbox that will make your work more appealing to viewers. 

Our homework was to create a site using all that we have learned up to this point.  The project was not overly difficult but there were some real challenges to get everything to align appropriately.  I got everything completed but it took a bit longer than anticipated.  Our next class is Forms and Inputs.  Class is fun and learning these effects is wonderful.
