Lesson 8 was the most difficult class up to this point.  It confused me and the assignments were challenging.  We discussed and learned the Box Model and the subject was familiar to me but the class was still difficult.  The in class project took much longer than anticipated and I had more than my fair share of difficulties.  In the end I was able to get the hang of it but it was not an easy class for me.

For homework we finished the in class assignment and read ahead for the next class.  Our reading was to prepare us for the next subject, which is CSS Reset and Multiple page website, Our reading assignment is “CSS Best Practices” and “CSS Reset”.
