Lesson 1
The intro class began with the setup of our environment.  We setup our Github and forked our projects for the intro class, atom and google environments.  This was all new to me so it was a bit intimidating but I was able to keep up.  We met our instructors and they are both very knowledgeable and yet very approachable.  We could not ask for better instructors.

Lesson 2 
As with every class there is homework and that was accomplished for this class.  There is reading and an exercise to complete. 

we needed to accomplish:
Pre-work Quiz
Reading assignments:
  W3School HTML
  W3School Tags

In class we began looking at HTML and the elements that will be used.  During the practical portion we created our first website.  We always work in pairs and it is nice to have someone to share ideas with and to bounce ideas off of.  

After the second lesson I am finding this a very fun class but also know there is a lot to learn and understand.

Until I get caught up with this blog I will continue to work two lessons at a time.  We just finished our third week (Lesson 6) and I am learning quite a bit and still find our instructors second to none.
