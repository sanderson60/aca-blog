Lesson 18 was “officially” the beginning of our final project for the class, even though some of us have already started working on the assignment.  This will put everything we have learned into one neat bundle.  There are a few more specialty items we learned using fixed navigation and parallax.  These are nice ways to make style the pages and add a bit more flair to them. The project went well but there is still more to complete and it was a lot of fun incorporating all that I have learned.  

Our homework was to take complete our Final Project and to have it ready for the next and final class of the Intro Course. Those of us that are moving on to the next course also need to get finished with our pre-course work.  By all indicators this is going to be one difficult class.
