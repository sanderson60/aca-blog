Lesson 17 was creating forms and inputs.  Overall the project went well and it was a lot of fun incorporating all that I have learned.  As a class we created a site for a band and added a form to gather email addresses.  My partner and I collaborated very well and got the project completed with no real issues.  A good night of class and the end is coming quickly.  We have a great class and most of us are going to go to the next level. 
Our homework was to take a previously created project or create a new project for a company and create an application form for the company.  We also need to work on our final project that will be due next week and there are a significant amount of requirements that need to meet.
