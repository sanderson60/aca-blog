Lesson 12 was more challenging than some others.  We learned how to build a webpage using Bootstrap.  This was a bit confusing and our in class project went fairly well.  I had a great partner and we worked together to get this accomplished.  I still had a few minor things to complete after the end of class and there were a few things that really confused me but it was all good.  

Our homework was to complete another webpage using Bootstrap and this was more challenging than anticipated.  I ran into a few stumbling blocks but I was able to complete the assignment.  I am learning a lot and there is so much more to learn.  Our next class is on Bootstrap Responsive Utility and our reading assignment is Block vs. Inline and Google Maps. Things are heating up in the lessons and there is already a decision matrix on whether or not to take the next class.  Things are going very well and I look forward to class.
